Mostly packed rock and gravel with patches of clay on the bottom half and patches of loose gravel on the top half. The council blades this 4wd track about once a year so it is usually in good condition, however serious ruts do form after heavy rain. The surrounding hills are mostly covered in gorse which is slowly regenerating. In late spring the lower slopes turn purple with a weed daisy that has taken hold. This track can be ridden in either direction, and is quite exposed to the northerly which can add extra challenge on the upper half. The views from the top are excellent, and on a clear day you can see all of Wellington and harbour, the Tararua mountains and the top of the South Island.','Going up. The climb is in two main sections with a brief descent/rest in the middle. The climbing starts immediately at the big metal gate at the bottom. You climb up the right flank of the ridge for about 1.5k with gorse on either side of you. About 1/4 of the way up you go around a sharp left-hand bend where you can see all the way up to the old cattle yards at the half way point. The bottom third is probably the steepest but usually has the least loose gravel. There are several large water-bars to roll through. After this the gradient slowly levels off as you approach the cattle yards. The next kilometre rolls up then down as you traverse across to the next part of the climb. As you come around a large right-hand bend with the bank on your right, there is a track off to your left that goes to [[track:56]] (marked with a short chunky wooden post). Stay on the main trail. Once through the saddle the climb starts again sidling to the right with more gorse. There are a few tough left-hand corners here with plenty of loose gravel which can be a real challenge to ride. There is a major intersection to Red Rocks about 400m from the top (you can see the top for the last 3rd of the ride). The turn-off is well marked and the Tip Track continues on to the right. This last section is not quite so steep as the track takes you up to a metal pole-gate at the top. If the northerly is really blowing and you want a sit down then you can usually find some shelter just below the sealed road where the Tip Track joins. Views to the South Island are best from the summit about 300m further up the sealed road.[[para]]Coming down. This is a very fast descent. Going down you really don\'t notice the loose gravel patches and the main difficulty is keeping your speed down so you can make the bends comfortably. Beware the water-bars on the bottom third which can be quite deep and rutty after big rain. There are also some clay patches here which can be greasy if it has been wet.','The bottom of the Tip Track starts at the big metal gates immediately to the left of the road to the rubbish dump off Happy Valley road (about 5km south of Brooklyn). There is signage at the gate for Te Kopuhou Reserve, and another on the gate saying \"Emergency Vehicle Access\".[[para]]The top can be reached by continuing on up the sealed road from the Brooklyn wind turbine. The track starts on the left, just up from the orange concrete-block castle - beware of the dragons (dogs). Or if you are coming from the summit of Hawkins Hill it is about 300m down from the \"golf ball\" (Airways Corporation aircraft monitoring station) on the outside of a right-hand bend. If you pass the castle you have gone too far.','',3.50,432,16,34,450,' (when going up)',4,'','2006-09-23',1,-41.334225,174.741562,14),(24,'Car Parts',3,'Open','','A flowing twisty single track through a tunnel of regenerating scrub. A base of gravel and rock with a rich dark dirt cover can get very messy when wet. Due to the close bush cover and south-east aspect this track takes a long time to dry out and can stay wet for most of the winter. It can be ridden in either direction but is most popular as a descent. There are good views over Wellington and harbour from the top, and even some glimpses of the Kaikoura mountains.','From the wind turbine you drop down a short rutty slope to the start of the single track. This is the steepest part, and probably the most difficult. You then traverse along for about 50m before you pass a major ridge heading south on your right. Along this ridge is the [[track:26]] track. [[track:24]] then enters the bush and is narrow and nearly all downhill with one short uphill section that cannot be coasted up. At the top of this there is a blue refrigerator, but no time for refreshments as it\'s all downhill from here to the end. The track suddenly emerges from the bush at a grassy area next to the sealed road. Cross here to join the [[track:25]] track. Or there is a short zig zag across the grass to the next corner on the sealed road if you want to carry on to Brooklyn.','The top entrance/exit to [[track:24]] is directly across the carpark at the Brooklyn wind turbine. The bottom entrace/exit pops out of the bush where the sealed road meets the [[track:25]] track for the first time when coming up. There is a bike-friendly style between the [[track:25]] and the sealed road, and [[track:24]] is directly across from this.','Be wary of vehicles when exiting the lower end, it can be particularly busy on weekends.[[newline]]This track is popular with the shuttle crowd as you can drive to the top.',1.00,7,84,376,299,' (when going down)',3,'','2006-01-08',1,-41.308472,174.746201,16),(25,'Fenceline',4,'Open','','This 4wd track follows the predator-proof fence around the Karori Bird Sanctuary. The bird sanctuary covers a large valley and the adjoining flanks of [[area:4]] and [[area:3]], so the track includes two good climbs if done as a loop (to complete the loop add [[track:34]] and [[track:31]]).','From George Denton Park go through the metal gate and follow the track up. Very soon you will meet the bird sanctuary fence. You can follow the fence in either direction, however heading up (left) from here is the most popular way to go. The 4wd track continues up in short steep rises up to the wind turbine. From here the gradient is generally more rolling until you reach the highest point, also known as the tapu sign. The views east from here are excellent. After a short descent you will pass a gap in the regular fence on your left - this is the last exit if you wish to go up towards [[area:2]]. From here the track traverses for about 300 metres before diving down to the glade. Beware of this descent if wet as the gradient increases going down culminating in a rutty clay section before levelling off again. From the glade you can access [[area:Long Gully]]. To continue around the [[track:25]] keep the fence on your right and head up. The track climbs for about 500 metres before levelling off again. Just past a transmission tower there is an intersection on your left that will take you to the [[area:4]] parade ground. [[track:25]] continues for about another 500 metres before it meets the [[track:31]] track. You can go down the steep hill beside the fence but it is extremely steep with loose gravel and rocks, beware.','There are many places to access this track. The most popular would be via the [[track:28]] from George Denton Park at the end of Highbury Road in Highbury.[[para]]Another popular access is from the Parade Ground at the top of [[area:4]]. From the sealed access road, go around the metal pole gate on to a gravel 4wd road. Take the next right over another metal pole gate. After about 500m you will come to a large grassy area, this is the Parade Ground. Head east towards the wind turbine, and when you meet the predator-proof fence turn right.','This track is popular with walkers/runners and their dogs. Also after a good storm the fence is checked by the bird sanctuary people, so watch out for vehicles.

After this things settle down as the track winds through the bush over various small wooden bridges and corners. The first intersection to Woodhouse Ave is on a sharpish right-hand switch-back. It is clearly marked with a large sign that says \"no bikes\". After this the track levels off for about 700 metres. Continue climbing. There are a couple of brief downhill bits but it\'s pretty much up hill all the way to the next intersection to [[track:43]]. Continuing straight on the track climbs for only anoth 250 metres before levelling off. The last 500 metres is level and then slightly down. As you sweep around a downhill bend out of the bush past the turn-off to [[track:30]], the top carpark straight ahead about 30 metres on.','The top can be reached from the first carpark on [[area:4]], which is on your right coming up Wrights Hill road just where the gradient levels off on a sharp left-hand bend. The bottom can be reached from the end of Fitzgerald Place, it is the most obvious trail on the north side of the parking area. The less obvious track is the exit to [[track:30]].','This track has been designed with decreasing radius corners (from downhill pov) which is an attempt to reduce the speed of riders coming down. This makes for a \'power climb\' as you can accellerate out of the corners.[[para]]This track was originally (officially) called Skyline and is a part of the \'Skyline Trail\'.

The easiest entry to find is Normal which is described above. Another popular entry is Parade Drop (or [[track:52]]). This entry starts in the grass at the dip in the road (big puddle in winter) about 30 metres from the Parade Ground\'s northern road access. After a short sharp start [[track:52]] traverses north with a few steep sections that are probably at their most technical when super dry as the loose rocks are like ball bearings. Continue traversing/dropping downwards and you will meet Evil and Pure evil coming in on your right. After another 300 metres you will join [[track:30]]. For a more challenging start try the entry known as Evil. It can be found FIXME. Evil divides into Pure Evil at about 150 metres.

When it comes time to fall you usually have very little time to react so your reactions have to be instant, reflex, or dare I say it cat-like. To get your falling down reactions cat-like takes time and years of practice, and remember the ground is hard and your skin is soft, and your bones don\'t bend very well. So I was thinking while looking down at my front wheel, which was perfectly in line with the back wheel, that there really shouldn\'t be so much blue sky down there.

I raced in Vet 1 and the pace was pretty hot from the start with Jason Goldie, Andrew McFarlane and myself getting a good gap by the end of [[track:3]]. I had a pre-race plan that if I was feeling good I would attack on the 4wd up from [[track:12]] to the summit. It worked a treat and I got a nice gap before the fast narrow descent of [[track:4]]. I hammered the descent and with very few riders to pass extended my lead. I bridged up to and gapped pro-elite rider and last year\'s pro-elite overall winner Gavin McCarthy on the climb up to [[track:9]], very satisfying! The rest of the race was pretty straight forward with not many riders from other classes to pass. I nearly cleared [[track:65]] with only 1 dab on one of the early rocky corners.
