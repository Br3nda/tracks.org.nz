From Ian email below:

  I've been toying with potential track information features.  As a test, I've created a random collection of ideas at www.i-nth.com/trackbits/index.html
  The track's altitude profile chart would also be useful information, especially since hills are a prominant feature of most Wellington tracks.
  There are a few bugs in these examples.  For example the enlarged chart and slideshow images don't play nice with the Earth map type if they overlap (ie. the 3D map is always in front of the images) - but I suspect there isn't much I can do about that.
  The features on this page are just at the conceptual stage and require a bit more work.  Nonetheless, I think that at least some of them have potential.
  Thoughts?

Finish validations
Finish add track paths, including upload path file, GPX and KML
Finish email registration
Search: tracks, track_akas, areas, states (area_akas?)
Add area_akas?
Fix the whole page centering thing, go wide, maybe 1000 pixels...
User feature: favourite track(s)
User feature: preferred gmap display type
Front page image:
  1. plain pic
  2. "map" with clickable site features as destinations (home|random track|about|random pic|ride choosa|faq|terms|contact|...)
In track/show the track_aka code should be moved out of view


 
6. Altitude profile
 
Since hills are such a prominent feature of Wellington tracks, an altitude profile graph would be a great addition to each track’s description.  I’ve briefly toyed with an expandable image, but haven’t thought much beyond that about how the profile could be presented.
 
I have created a rough spreadsheet that extracts coordinate and altitude data from a gpx file.  It then calculates distances between the coordinate pairs, which creates the data needed for an altitude profile chart.  The spreadsheet also provides an option to smooth the altitude profile, taking out the inevitable glitches recorded by the GPS.
 
 
8. Numeric track names
 
You may recall that I broke something when I tried to create a track called ‘491’ in the Wainuiomata Trail Project.  The problem was, I assume, that the database refers to tracks by number which didn't work because track 491 doesn't exist.  You renamed the track ‘T491’, which fixed the problem but it isn’t quite right. 
 
Is there any way of allowing numeric track names?
 
  
12. Display multiple tracks on a map
 
It would be very helpful if we could display multiple tracks on a map.  Currently, it can be difficult to see how one track relates to others nearby.  If we could display the track of interest and nearby tracks on the same map, then it would be easier to understand how the tracks fit together.
 
One approach might be to rename the “Connecting Tracks” list to be a “Nearby Tracks”  list (since the tracks don’t necessarily connect, they might just be nearby) and use that list as a basis for adding their kml files to the currently displayed track map too.  The current and nearby tracks could be distinguished by using different colours, so that the focus is still on the current track.  Or something like that.
 
I have been playing with some offline examples of displaying multiple tracks on a map.  This works OK, provided there isn’t too much data – either long tracks with lots of points, or more than a few tracks – otherwise the browser complains about the time taken to run the JavaScript, or the map simply locks up.  There seems to be ways to deal with these issues, but I haven’t reached a conclusion yet.
 
As an aside, I updated the Car Parts Extension map to show actual and planned track using different colours.  This uses a single kml file to show multiple tracks, giving each its own style.  This approach works for that specific purpose, but wouldn’t work well for showing multiple tracks on a map – in that case, I think it is better to keep each track’s data in a separate file and just display them together when needed.




15. Bold formatting looks the same as a hyperlink - is there a way to avoid confusion between bold and links?
